# Mercury

An end-to-end encrypted chat service.

## I'm lost... help!

* Fret not fellow homosapien!
* Instructions for setting up the server are [here](https://github.com/fabiocolacio/Mercury/tree/master/mercury-server#mercury-server).
* The client is coming soon.
* Other tidbits can be found at the [wiki](https://github.com/fabiocolacio/Mercury/wiki).

## Whats with the name?

This program is named after the [Roman God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(mythology)) of messages and communication!

Evidently, he is also the patron god of thieves, so perhaps it's not the best name for a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging platform ðŸ¤”
